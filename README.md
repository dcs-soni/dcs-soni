Hey there! I'm a software engineer who loves building things with code. I dive into everything from full-stack web development to UX design and always try to explore new tech. Here, you'll find a mix of my personal projects, open-source contributions, and experiments with cool tools and frameworks. Feel free to check them out, collaborate, or just reach out to chat!

Currently, I am exploring and diving deep to understand open-source projects to contribute, for example, ![kvrocks](https://github.com/apache/kvrocks), ![echarts](https://github.com/apache/echarts), and much more. Let's stay in touch to know more about my contributions in such projects.
